# Dataproject

The objective with our dataproject is to show how stocks and google searches are related. Our project displays a few different stocks with correspondig google searches - this is not an econometrical excersize by any means - but more so to showcase the use of python to illustrate how data can be compared, and made interactive.  
We also have a few extra graphs and figures, such as the SPX index against 10-year US bond prices, even though google searches and stock prices on one hand seem far from bond prices, we can work with them very similarily in python.

I order for you to get the same results as us you need to download a few packages though anaconda prompt or alike.
Needed packages:
```
pip install pytrends
pip install plotly
pip install cufflinks
pip install fix_yahoo_finance
```

All data you will need is either in the "Data" folder, or is directly downloaded to your computer from IEX or yahoo and alike.
